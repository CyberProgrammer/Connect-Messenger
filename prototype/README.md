# Connect Messenger Prototype

## WARNING
Bugs are expected in the prototype version that are not found in the production version. Code was rewritten to bypass authentication checks and some core functionalities now behaves different in some cases.
The code is just to demonstrate the look, feel, and core functions of the web application.

### Create Chat
Users can create a new chat here aswell as sending an initial message to a created group chat. If a existing chat is already found, only your message will be added to the existing chat
instead of creating a new chat. There can only be a single chat between two users.

### Groups
The groups section is used to create or modify groups. Only group creators have rights to modify a group.

### Create Group
Users can set a group name, invite users, and send a optional message. If a initial message is not sent, the creator would have to send a message using the create chat feature.

### Edit Group
The group creator of a group can modify a group name, invite users, and remove invited users. Once the changes are made, any connected clients that are apart of the group will have the reflected changes.
